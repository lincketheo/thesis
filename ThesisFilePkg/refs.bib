	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Solar flares produce radiation that can have an almost immediate effect on the near-Earth environment, making it crucial to forecast flares in order to mitigate their negative effects. The number of published approaches to flare forecasting using photospheric magnetic field observations has proliferated, with varying claims about how well each works. Because of the different analysis techniques and data sets used, it is essentially impossible to compare the results from the literature. This problem is exacerbated by the low event rates of large solar flares. The challenges of forecasting rare events have long been recognized in the meteorology community, but have yet to be fully acknowledged by the space weather community. During the interagency workshop on “all clear” forecasts held in Boulder, CO in 2009, the performance of a number of existing algorithms was compared on common data sets, specifically line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity images from the Michelson Doppler Imager, with consistent definitions of what constitutes an event. We demonstrate the importance of making such systematic comparisons, and of using standard verification statistics to determine what constitutes a good prediction scheme. When a comparison was made in this fashion, no one method clearly outperformed all others, which may in part be due to the strong correlations among the parameters used by different methods to characterize an active region. For M-class flares and above, the set of methods tends toward a weakly positive skill score (as measured with several distinct metrics), with no participating method proving substantially better than climatological forecasts.}

	title = {A Comparison of Flare Forecasting Methods. {II}. Benchmarks, Metrics, and Performance Results for Operational Solar Flare Forecasting Systems},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
	abstract = {Solar flares are extremely energetic phenomena in our solar system. Their impulsive and often drastic radiative increases, particularly at short wavelengths, bring immediate impacts that motivate solar physics and space weather research to understand solar flares to the point of being able to forecast them. As data and algorithms improve dramatically, questions must be asked concerning how well the forecasting performs; crucially, we must ask how to rigorously measure performance in order to critically gauge any improvements. Building upon earlier-developed methodology of Paper I (Barnes et al. 2016), international representatives of regional warning centers and research facilities assembled in 2017 at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan to, for the first time, directly compare the performance of operational solar flare forecasting methods. Multiple quantitative evaluation metrics are employed, with the focus and discussion on evaluation methodologies given the restrictions of operational forecasting. Numerous methods performed consistently above the “no-skill” level, although which method scored top marks is decisively a function of flare event definition and the metric used; there was no single winner. Following in this paper series, we ask why the performances differ by examining implementation details (Leka et al. 2019), and then we present a novel analysis method to evaluate temporal patterns of forecasting errors in Paper {IV} (Park et al. 2019). With these works, this team presents a well-defined and robust methodology for evaluating solar flare forecasting methods in both research and operational frameworks and today’s performance benchmarks against which improvements and new methods may be compared.}

	abstract = {Photospheric vector magnetic field data from the University of Hawai'i Imaging Vector Magnetograph, with good spatial and temporal sampling, are used to study the question of identifying a preflare signature unique to flare events in parameters derived from the magnetic vector field, B. In this first of a series of papers, we present the data analysis procedure and sample results focusing only on three active regions (NOAA Active Regions 8636, 8771, and 0030), three flares (two M class and one X class), and (most importantly) a flare-quiet epoch in a comparable flare-producing region. Quantities such as the distribution of the field morphology, horizontal spatial gradients of the field, vertical current, current helicity, "twist" parameter α, and magnetic shear angles are parameterized using their moments and appropriate summations. The time series of the resulting parameterizations are examined one at a time for systematic differences in overall magnitude and evolution between the flare and flare-quiet examples. The variations expected due to atmospheric seeing changes are explicitly included. In this qualitative approach we find (1) no obvious flare-imminent signatures from the plain magnetic field vector and higher moments of its horizontal gradient or from most parameterizations of the vertical current density; (2) counterintuitive but distinct flare-quiet implications from the inclination angle and higher moments of the photospheric excess magnetic energy; (3) flare-specific or flare-productivity signatures, sometimes weak, from the lower moments of the field gradients, kurtosis of the vertical current density, magnetic twist, current helicity density, and magnetic shear angle. The strongest results are, however, that (4) in ensuring a flare-unique signature, numerous candidate parameters (considering both their variation and overall magnitude) are nullified on account of similar behavior in a flare-quiet region, and hence (5) considering parameters one at a time in this qualitative manner is inadequate. To address these limitations, a quantitative statistical approach is presented in Paper II by Leka & Barnes.}

In an approach that parallels an earlier study by the authors using quantities describing the photospheric properties of the vector magnetic field, we define quantities derived from the MCT analysis that quantify the complexity and topology of the active region coronal fields. With the goal of distinguishing between flare-quiet and flare-imminent magnetic topology, the time series are initially displayed for three active regions for visual inspection with few clear distinguishing characteristics resulting. However, an analysis of all 24 epochs using the discriminant analysis statistical approach indicates that coronal field topology, derived from the observed photospheric vertical field, may indeed hold relevant information for distinguishing these populations, although the small sample size precludes a definite conclusion. The variables derived from the characterization of coronal topology routinely result in higher probabilities of being able to distinguish between the two populations than the analogous variables derived for the photospheric field.}

For this study, the vector field data are University of Hawai`i Imaging Vector Magnetograph daily magnetograms obtained between 2001 and 2004. Over 1200 separate magnetograms of 496 numbered active regions comprise the data set. At the soft X-ray C1.0 level, 359 magnetograms are considered "flare productive" in the 24 hr postobservation. Considering multiple photospheric variables simultaneously indicates that combinations of only a few familiar variables encompass the majority of the predictive power available. However, the choice of which few variables is not unique, due to strong correlations among photospheric quantities such as total magnetic flux and total vertical current, two of the most powerful predictors. The best discriminant functions result from combining one of these with additional uncorrelated variables, such as measures of the magnetic shear, and successfully classify over 80\% of the regions. By comparison, a success rate of approximately 70\% is achieved by simply classifying all regions as "flare quiet." Redefining "flare-productive" at the M1.0 level, parameterizations of excess photospheric magnetic energy outperform other variables. However, the uniform flare-quiet classification rate is approximately 90\%, while incorporating photospheric magnetic field information results in at most a 93\% success rate. Using nonparametric discriminant analysis, we demonstrate that the results are quite robust. Thus, we conclude that the state of the photospheric magnetic field at any given time has limited bearing on whether that region will be flare productive.}

SDO/HMI is the first space-based instrument to map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field with high cadence and continuity. The SHARP data series provide maps in patches that encompass automatically tracked magnetic concentrations for their entire lifetime; map quantities include the photospheric vector magnetic field and its uncertainty, along with Doppler velocity, continuum intensity, and line-of-sight magnetic field. Furthermore, keywords in the SHARP data series provide several parameters that concisely characterize the magnetic-field distribution and its deviation from a potential-field configuration. These indices may be useful for active-region event forecasting and for identifying regions of interest. The indices are calculated per patch and are available on a twelve-minute cadence. Quick-look data are available within approximately three hours of observation; definitive science products are produced approximately five weeks later. SHARP data are available at jsoc.stanford.eduand maps are available in either of two different coordinate systems. This article describes the SHARP data products and presents examples of SHARP data and parameters.},

In this paper, we present an automated hybrid computer platform for the short-term prediction of significant solar flares using SOHO/Michelson Doppler Imager images. This platform is called the Automated Solar Activity Prediction tool (ASAP). This system integrates image processing and machine learning to deliver these predictions. A machine learning-based system is designed to analyze years of sunspot and flare data to create associations that can be represented using computer-based learning rules. An imaging-based real-time system that provides automated detection, grouping, and then classification of recent sunspots based on the McIntosh classification is also created and integrated within this system. The properties of the sunspot regions are extracted automatically by the imaging system and processed using the machine learning rules to generate the real-time predictions. Several performance measurement criteria are used and the results are provided in this paper. Also, quadratic score is used to compare the prediction results of ASAP with NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) between 1999 and 2002, and it is shown that ASAP generates more accurate predictions compared to SWPC.},

The processes that enable and trigger these flares remain topics of intense study and debate. I analyze observations of 289 X- and M-class flares and over 2500 active region magnetograms to discover (1) that large flares, without exception, are associated with pronounced high-gradient polarity-separation lines, while (2) the free energy that emerges with these fibrils is converted into flare energy in a broad spectrum of flare magnitudes that may well be selected at random from a power-law distribution up to a maximum value. This maximum is proportional to the total unsigned flux R within ~15 Mm of strong-field, high-gradient polarity-separation lines, which are a characteristic appearance of magnetic fibrils carrying electrical currents as they emerge through the photosphere. Measurement of R is readily automated, and R can therefore be used effectively for flare forecasting. The probability for major flares to occur within 24 hr of the measurement of R approaches unity for active regions with the highest values of R around 2 × 1021 Mx. For regions with R ≲ 1019 Mx, no M- or X-class flares occur within a day.}

	abstract = {Current operational forecasts of solar eruptions are made by human experts using a combination of qualitative shape-based classiﬁcation systems and historical data about ﬂaring frequencies. In the past decade, there has been a great deal of interest in crafting machine-learning ({ML}) ﬂare-prediction methods to extract underlying patterns from a training set – e.g. a set of solar magnetogram images, each characterized by features derived from the magnetic ﬁeld and labeled as to whether it was an eruption precursor. These patterns, captured by various methods (neural nets, support vector machines, etc.), can then be used to classify new images. A major challenge with any {ML} method is the featurization of the data: pre-processing the raw images to extract higher-level properties, such as characteristics of the magnetic ﬁeld, that can streamline the training and use of these methods. It is key to choose features that are informative, from the standpoint of the task at hand. To date, the majority of {ML}-based solar eruption methods have used physics-based magnetic and electric ﬁeld features such as the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, the gradients of the ﬁelds, the vertical current density, etc. In this paper, we extend the relevant feature set to include characteristics of the magnetic ﬁeld that are based purely on the geometry and topology of 2D magnetogram images and show that this improves the prediction accuracy of a neural-net based ﬂare-prediction method.},

Correlations with solar flares excel those with the earlier Zurich classification, prompting the use of the {McIntosh} classification in an expert system (Theo) for predicting X-ray solar flares.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of solar flares is modeled assuming that the magnetic field is force-free and that its evolution is quasi-static. This model is simplified so as to be tractable and yields a semi-linear elliptic equation in a halfplane depending on a parameter λ which describes the time evolution. It is proved that there are (at least) two branches of solutions which have distinct asymptotic behaviors at infinity. The upper branch exists for all λ {\textgreater} 0, but the lower branch exists only on a finite interval [0, λc ]. As stable solutions must have the same asymptotic behavior as the lower branch of solutions, and as this is impossible after λc, we contend that no stable solution exists after λc and that a solar flare is thus triggered.},

We report our attempt of characterizing a more realistic solar atmosphere by including a plasma with temperature stratified from the photosphere to the corona in the {CESE}-{MHD} model. The resulted photospheric transverse flow is comparable to the apparent movements of the magnetic flux features that demonstrates shearing and rotations. We calculated the relevant parameters such as the magnetic energy flux and helicity flux, and with analysis of these parameters, we find that magnetic non-potentiality is transported across the photosphere into the corona in the simulated time interval, which might provide a favorable condition for producing the flare.},
